# B+-Programming-Language

B+ Programming language is a beginner friendly programming language which aims to teach new programmer the logic of programming without concerning much about the syntax etc. It aims to take away things which could confuse new programmers and for them to start understanding the logic of the whole thing. Its recommended for them to learn B+ and a language such as lua or python at the same time as B+ will help with understanding basic logic of programming and other languages help them to understand the basics syntax of most languages. Combining both will result in a beginner friendly and easy programming experience. B+ isnt made for bigger projects as it aims to help beginners make simple programs such as a calculator or something like that.

B+ is a Programming language made for starters to get into programming very easily by terminating different prefixes etc. No need to put = or +, -, *, /.

Given variables:
	MATH.PI = Pi
	MATH.random = a random number from 0 to 255 which generates each time the programm starts and cant be changed while program is running.
	MATH.dice = a random number from 1 to 6
	window.h = default is 500, sets the window height
	window.w = default is 600, sets the window width
	window.title = default is 'My Application!', sets the window Title

out:
	The out command replaces the print command as its mostly known of. It outputs text to the Terminal. An example command would be: out Hello World! <<.
	the <<, >> prefixes determines wether it is a variable or string. if you put a >> at the end it will search for a variable named Hello and output its value.

var, str:
	Programming would be empty without any variables. The use is: var a 1 or str a 1. As the name suggests var stands for variable and str for string. The reason
	why i didn't put int instead of var is because it can var can also take float.

take:
	Take gets an input of a user in the shell and puts it in a variable which you give it. Example: take number What is your preffered number?

rand:
	Use: rand generated_number 0 255, generates a number between 0 and 255 with the given variable of generated_number.

if and ifn:
	The if statement is a common statement amognst all programming languages and is one of the most important one. With it you can make multiple possibilities how a programm would work for example if a is 1 then... The ifn statement is the negative of the if statement and checks if the statement is NOT true. with this you can make multiple possible ways a program will work.

add, sub, mul, div:
	add = addition, sub = subtraction, mul = multiplication, div = division, with these basic statements you can make simple mathematical calculations of numbers and variables.

func:
	With "func" you can create functions which are lines of codes which can be recalled at any time.
